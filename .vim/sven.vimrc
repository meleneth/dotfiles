" Info on the latest versions of Vim are on the Vim Home Page:
"   http://www.vim.org/
" Mind you, those pages are a *mirror* of the pages at
"   http://www.math.fu-berlin.de/~guckes/vim/
" ===================================================================
" The latest versions of Vim are usually in my signature file:
" http://www.math.fu-berlin.de/~guckes/sig/SIGS  Comments?
" ===================================================================
" Installation of this setup file:
"  To use this setup file, copy it to
"  this filename    on these systems:
"    ~/.vimrc       Unix and OS/2
"    s:.vimrc       Amiga
"    $VIM\_vimrc    MS-DOS and Win32
" ===================================================================
" version check:
" The first line of this setup file contains the information
" "version xxx" which allows VIM to check whether the setup file
" fits the syntax that it understands.
" Versions of VIM other than of version 5 then will give a warning
" as they do not understand this setup file command - a feature:
" Give a warning so the user knows that there is something odd
" about the setup file.
" ===================================================================
" ===================================================================
" Structure of this file:
" Lines starting with an inverted comma (") are comments.
" Some mappings are commented out.  Remove the comment to enable them.
"
" There are three kinds of things which are defined in this file:
" Mapping ("map"), settings ("set"), and abbreviations ("ab").
"   Settings affect the behaviour of commands.
"   Mappings maps a key sequence to a command.
"   Abbreviations define words which are replaced
"   right *after* they are typed in.
"
" ===================================================================
" Note on mappings - "angle notation" (see ":help <>"):
" VIM allows you to define mappings with special characters
" with a notation that uses non-special characters:
" The notation encloses decriptive words in angle brackets (<>).
" The characters you will most often are:
" <C-M> for control-m
" <C-V> for control-v which quotes the following character
" <ESC> for the escape character.
" All control characters have been replaced to use the angle notation
" so you should be able to read this file without problems.
" (Well, sometimes I leave some tabs [control-i] in the file. ;-)
" ===================================================================
" External programs:
" Some mappings make use of external programs.
" The following you should find/have on every UNIX system:
" cut, date; awk, egrep, grep, ispell, perl, sed.
" If you are using DOS then you should get these for you system!!
" See http://www.math.fu-berlin.de/~guckes/dos/ for some pointers!
" ===================================================================
" Online Help - jump to help positions with "\\":
" On some keyboards you will have some trouble with C-],
" the command to jump to the current help tag.
" The following mapping allows to use "\\", too:
  map \\  <C-]>
" ===================================================================
" The command ":version" does not show the current value of
" VIMRUNTIME - dang!  So I need a fast way to display that value:
  map :V :echo $VIMRUNTIME<c-m>

" SETTING OPTIONS
" ===================================================================
" There are many options for Vim - over 200.   Here is an overview:

" ===================================================================
"
"       autoindent, paste, textwidth:
"       I keep changing these values - just as the case may be.
"       Now, if functions keys actually worked on all keyboards
"       then I'd probably defines a toggle for each of them...
"
"       autoindent:  "off" as I usually do not write code.
  set noautoindent
"
"       autowrite: Automatically save modifications to files
"       when you use critical (rxternal) commands.
  set   autowrite

  set   digraph
"
"       errorbells: damn this beep!  ;-)

" In case you want this for SunOS only:
" if system('uname')=='SunOS'

"       expandtab:  Expand Tabs?  Rather not.
"                   See 'listchars' to make Tabs visible!

"
"       formatoptions:  Options for the "text format" command ("gq")

" FAQ:  Q: How can I quit insertmode when using this option?
"       A: The option "insertmode" was not meant for "start Vim in
"       insert mode" only; the idea is to *stay* in insert mode.
"       Anyway, you can use the command |i_CTRL-O| to issue commands.
  set noinsertmode

"
"       iskeyword:
"       iskeyword=@,48-57,_,192-255   (default)
" Add the dash ('-'), the dot ('.'), and the '@' as "letters" to "words".
" This makes it possible to expand email and html addresses,
" eg guckes-www@vim.org and http://www.vim.org/

"       'list' + 'listchars': Great new feature of vim-5.3!
"       This tells Vim which characters to show for expanded TABs,
"       trailing whitespace, and end-of-lines.  VERY useful!!
" Standard settings:
" set   list
" set   listchars=tab:>-,trail:·,eol:$
"
" However: The '$' at the end of lines is a bit too much, though.
" And I quite like the character that shows a dot in the middle:
" set   listchars=tab:>·,trail:·
"
" Some people might prefer a double right angle (>>)
" to show the start of expanded tabs, though:
" set   listchars=tab:»·,trail:·
"
" However, this all breaks up when viewing high-bit characters
" through some brain-dead telnet program (there are many).
" Sometimes a change of the font does the trick.  Try it!

" ===================================================================
" MAPpings
" ===================================================================
" Caveat:  Mapping must be "prefix free", ie no mapping must be the
" prefix of any other mapping.  Example:  "map ,abc foo" and
" "map ,abcd bar" will give you the error message "Ambigous mapping".
"
" The backslash ('\') is the only(?) unmapped key, so this is the best
" key to start mappings with as this does not take away a command key.
" However, the backslash is never in the same position with keyboards.
" Eg on German keyboards it is AltGr-sz - don't ask.
" Anyway, I have decided to start mappings with the comma as this
" character is always on the same position on almost all keyboards
" and I hardly have a need for that command.
"
" The following maps get rid of some basic problems:
"
" When the backspace key sends a "delete" character
" then you simply map the "delete" to a "backspace" (CTRL-H):
" map <Del> <C-H>
"
" With Vim-4 the format command was just 'Q' and
" I am too used to it.  So I need this back!
  nnoremap Q gq
  vnoremap Q gq
"
" 980527 I often reformat a paragraph to fit some textwidth -
" and I use the following mapping to adjust it to the
" current position of the cursor:
  map #tw :set textwidth=<C-R>=col(".")<C-M>
"
" 981210 Whenever I paste some text into VIM I have to
" toggle from "nopaste" to "paste" and back again:
" map <f4>   :set paste!<C-M>:set paste?<C-M>
" map <esc>[14~ :set paste!<C-M>:set paste?<C-M>
" --> new option for this:  'pastetoggle'
"
" "tal" is the "trailer alignment" filter program
" Hopefully it will ship with Vim one day.
" vmap #t !tal<CR>
" vmap #t !tal -p 0<CR>
"
" Disable the command 'K' (keyword lookup) by mapping it
" to an "empty command".  (thanks, Lawrence! :-):
" map K :<CR>
" map K :<BS>
" More elegant:  (Hi Aziz! :-)
  map K <NUL>
"
" Disable the suspend for ^Z.
" I use Vim under "screen" where a suspend would lose the
" connection to the " terminal - which is what I want to avoid.
  map <C-Z> :shell
"
" Make CTRL-^ rebound to the *column* in the previous file
  noremap <C-^> <C-^>`"
"
" Make "gf" rebound to last cursor position (line *and* column)
  noremap gf gf`"
"
" When I let Vim write the current buffer I frequently mistype the
" command ":w" as ":W" - so I have to remap it to correct this typo:
  nmap :W :w
" TODO:  Use the following (after some testing):
" command -nargs=? -bang W w<bang> <args>
"
" Are you used to the Unix commands "alias" and "which"?
" I sometimes use these to look up my abbreviations and mappings.
" So I need them available on the command line:
  map :alias map
  map :which map
"
" The command {number}CTRL-G show the current nuffer number, too.
" This is yet another feature that vi does not have.
" As I always want to see the buffer number I map it to CTRL-G.
" Pleae note that here we need to prevent a loop in the mapping by
" using the comamnd "noremap"!
  noremap <C-G> 2<C-G>

" Elijah http://www.mathlab.sunysb.edu/~elijah/pgppub.html says :
" The significant feature is that stderr is redirected independently
" of stdout, and it is redirected to /dev/tty which is a synonym for
" the current terminal on Unix.  I don't know why the ||sleep 4
" stuff is there, but it is harmless so I left it. Since csh is such
" junk, special rules are used if you are using it (tcsh, too).
" ksh and bash should use the sh form. zsh, et al: consult your
" manual.  The #<num> format is used to map function keys. If your
" terminal does not support the requested function key, use a
" literal #<num>.  Not all of the clones correctly support this.

" AutoCommands
" ===================================================================
"
" Autocommands are the key to "syntax coloring".
" There's one command in your vimrc that should
" load/source the file $VIM/syntax/syntax.vim
" which contains the definition for colors and
" the autocommands that load other syntax files
" when necessary, ie when the filename matches
" a given pattern, eg "*.c" or *".html".
"
" just load the main syntax file when Vim was compiled with "+syntax"
  if has("syntax")
    " The following sources the main syntax file,
    " ie. "$VIM/syntax/syntax.vim", see ":help :syn-on":
      syntax on
    " Redefine the color for "Comment":
    " hi! Comment  term=bold ctermfg=cyan ctermbg=black guifg=blue guibg=black
"     hi! Comment            ctermfg=blue ctermbg=black guifg=blue guibg=black
      hi! Comment  term=NONE cterm=NONE
      hi! Comment  ctermfg=cyan ctermbg=black guifg=blue guibg=black
    "
    " The standard background color for the GUI Vim is "blue".
    " No, I don't know why.  But many users want to change this
    " color to black so they can read the blue colored text.  ;-)
    " Here's how:
    " hi normal ctermbg=black guibg=black
    "
    " Adjustments for editing messages:
    if version>=508
    " the following file contains commands
    " which simply change a few colors:
    au Syntax mail  source ~guckes/.vim.mail.vim
    endif
  endif
"
" Definition of an alternative syntax file:
" if has("syntax")
"   " Define the filename patterns for mail and news:
"   " MAILNEWSFILES... (missing, damn)
"   " Define the aucommand tow work on special files:
"     let aucommand = "au BufNewFile,BufRead ".MAILNEWSFILES
"   " execute the source command:
"     exe aucommand." source ~guckes/.P/vim/syntax/sven.vim"
"   "
" endif
"
"
" EXAMPLE: Restricting mappings to some files only:
" An autocommand does the macthing on the filenames -
" but abbreviations are not expanded within autocommands.
" Workaround:  Use "exe" for expansion:
" let aucommand = "au BufNewFile,BufRead ".MAILNEWSFILES
" exe aucommand." :map ,hi 1G}oHi!<CR><ESC>"
" exe aucommand." :map ,ha 1G}oHello, again!<CR><ESC>"
" exe aucommand." :map ,H G/Quoting /e+1<CR>ye1G}oHallo, !<ESC>Po<ESC>"
" exe aucommand." :map ,re 1G}oRe!<CR><ESC>"
"
" Automatically place the cursor onto the first line of the mail body:
" autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead MAILNEWSFILES :normal 1G}j
"
" Toggle syntax coloring on/off with "__":
" nn __ mg:if has("syntax_items")<Bar>syn clear<CR>else<Bar>syn on<CR>en<CR>`g
" Note:  It works - but the screen flashes are quite annoying.  :-/
"
